# Eri_sor
python version 2.7.11, with Pycharm as the IDE
R version darwin13.4.0 with Rstudio as the IDE

find_barcodes.R is simply a script to loop through the barcodes file and return the barcodes for individuals from outgroups.

Then I will need a script that will loop through all of my data and remove reads with that barcode. (Before I start analysis.)
